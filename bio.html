      <h3>
       Born and raised in California, Kevin Shum graduated last month from MIT with an undergraduate degree in computer science and engineering.  His concentration is at the intersection of design and engineering, and has worked as a researcher at the MIT Media Lab and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. This summer, Kevin is working in Accra at OZÃ‰, a startup that enables local entrepreneurs to grow their businesses. Before he starts a full-time job as a software engineer at Microsoft, he will be teaching STEM in Hong Kong and traveling around the Pacific. Catch him this summer eating a lot, taking a bunch of photos, and blogging for MIT!
