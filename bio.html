      <h3>
       Born and raised in California, Kevin Shum graduated last month from <a href="web.mit.edu">MIT</a> with an undergraduate degree in computer science and engineering.  His concentration is at the intersection of design and engineering, and has worked as a researcher at the MIT Media Lab and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. This summer, Kevin is working in Accra at OZÃ‰, a startup that enables local entrepreneurs to grow their businesses. Before he starts a full-time job as a software engineer at Microsoft, he will be teaching STEM in Hong Kong and traveling around the Pacific. Catch him this summer eating a lot, taking a bunch of photos, and blogging for MIT!
